# mergekube & remkube

A pair of helpful scripts to merge and remove kubeconfig files. The syntax for merging kubeconfig files can be a bit challenging to remember. And for removing a cluster from a kubeconfig - oh boy! That's multiple commands to get it right. I wrote these two bash scripts a few years ago to make these two tasks easier for myself and others.

## Installation

### Manual Installation
1. Simply place the mergekube and remkube files in your path (IE: /usr/local/bin or $HOME/bin)
2. Make them executable: 
 ```bash
 chmod +x remkube
 chmod +x mergekube
 ```
